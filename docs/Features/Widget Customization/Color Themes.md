# Color Themes

With the release of V3, the option to change the primary color of the widget backgrounds has been added. We ship with 6 different presets and also allow developers to choose a custom one if desired.

Developers can find the option for the Color Theme Preset on the BP_PerfBench_TestManager under the Setup > Widget section.
