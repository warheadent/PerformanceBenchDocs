# Score System

Score is accumulated by number of drawn frames since the test began. The higher the frame rate of the current user, the bigger score.

All tests ideally should be conducted with an uncapped (or extremely high cap) frame rate to allow for performance headroom analysis.

## Passing Score

The passing score is calculated based on a 60FPS sequence target.

By default, the Test Manager will accept a tolerance of 98% if the user doesn't *quite* achieve the 60FPS target.
