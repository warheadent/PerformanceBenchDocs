# Grading System

The grading system within Performance Benchmark is done based on tiers of performance.

The different tiers are driven by some float parameters found within TestManager.

These can be adjusted freely to customize the tolerance of the rating system. 

The intent of the default parameters should show that falling below 50% of the passing score is the user getting consistently less than 30 fps, which for most applications is generally not an ideal experience.
